1. I would set up LEDs so that the formed the digital 8 symbol. I would then 
   set up switches (4 of them) and the combination of switches on and off 
   correspond to a number in binary. That number would then be displayed on
   the LED 8 using logic gates and nodes to light up the correct sequence of
   LEDs.

2. My guess is that the random number generator works by clocking how fast
   the "ciruit" is working. Minute variations in time are used in creating
   the random number. Either that or there is a predetermined algorithm that
   will yield a number that may seem random but is not.
