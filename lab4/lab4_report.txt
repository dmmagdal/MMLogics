Lab 4 Ceaser Cipher
TA: Mike Powell

For this lab, I went with a Row Major array. I used a flag similar to the
previous lab, this time to tell if the string is to be decrypted or 
encrypted. Once that was store, I stored the input string to an array 
using a subroutine I wrote. I also had subroutines that encrypt or 
decrypt the string, depending on the flag called MODE. Encrypting took 
the input that was to be the OFFSET and shift the ascii values around 
for the alphabet and also took into account whether the char in each
cell is either an upper case or lower case. The same with Decrypting 
subroutine, although it took the reverse of the OFFSET to calculate. The
result would be stored in the next row of the array. A final subroutine
would print both rows of the array, labeled appropriately. 

For example, and string to be encrypted would be printed
Encrypted: encryptedstring
Decrypted: originalstring

and a string to be decrypted would be printed
Encrypted: originalstring
Decrypted: decryptedstring

.

The biggest challenge of this assignment was managing the minor errors in
the code that would cause the entire program to print the wrong things.
