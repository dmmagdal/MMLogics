I used conditons (BR) to make impromptu if statements. These were helpful
in having branching paths in the event of different inputs (such as x, 
positive, and negative numbers). The biggest challenge was keeping track 
the register values so that I can find the right condition code (nzp). 
Loops helped the program run full circle infinitely (or at least until x 
was pressed) or run operations such as multiplication or decrementing/
incrementing counter variables/ register. It was difficult keeping track
of how to terminate each loop. I used BR for that but again, it took a 
while tracking the register values to put the proper condition code. Labels
were a big help in creating the branches for BR and loops. I used them to
create what are methods/functions in higher level programming languages. 
I implemented this in creating and labeling sections of my flow chart, 
and I was able to compartmentalize each component and break down each 
step into chunks.
