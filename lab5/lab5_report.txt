Lab5: Intro to Uno32 and MIPS

Wow! you guys know how to pick em. The first part was relatively easy, but
still frustrating to debug. I still don't have one button working even 
though it theoretically should (It's the special one connected to RF).
The second part was also difficult in getting the lights to move back
down the line. To be honest, I ran out of time before I could get that
coded so it only goes one way.
